# I restored some old code...

Some time ago, I overlaid the original sources for the library and I had gotten rid of the git repo that held them. The files that had been hosted here for a while were a work-in-progress that ... well ... didn't work.

I was able to pull the original sources from the Wayback Machine tonight.  I had to make a few mods ... adapting the Windows-specific stuff to something that is more Mac-centric.

Have fun. I hope you find this little library useful.
